# Android-Breakout-Game
Idea is similar to an old arcade game called Breakout, with some variations. 

Used the concept of multi-threading and android motion sensor, accelerometer. 
In order to complete in this game one would need to break three layers of bricks. Each brick has a different color, and to break each brick it is required to hit the brick specific number of times depending on its color. Once the player touches the ball to the top of the screen, the game is completed.
After completing the game user will have option to store their highest score.
